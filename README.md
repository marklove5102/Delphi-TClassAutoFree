# Delphi-Class-AutoFree


# Description

An attempt at automating the process of releasing objects in Delphi without the need to use Try Finally blocks to free objects after their usage.

The idea behind this project is not to require the programmer to migrate their classes to an interface and to improve memory management. 
With the TAutoFree class, it's possible to turn a simple class into something like a interface without implementing anything new.

## Instalation

Add the folder where uClassAutoFree.pas is located to the Delphi library path or to your project's search path.

## Usage

Example of how to use the TAutoFree class

```Object pascal

uses uClassAutoFree

var
  LLocal: TMyClass;
begin
  LLocal:= TAutoFree<TMyClass>.New(TMyClass.Create).GetInstance;
  LLocal.FParam:= 'test'; 
  Showmessage(LLocal.FParam);  
  
 //LLocal its destroyed here
end;

```
