# Delphi-Class-AutoFree


# Description

An attempt at automating the process of releasing objects in Delphi without the need to use Try Finally blocks to free objects after their usage.

The idea behind this project is not to require the programmer to migrate their classes to an interface and to improve memory management. 
With the TAutoFree class, it's possible to turn a simple class into something like a interface without implementing anything new.

## Instalation

Add the folder where uClassAutoFree.pas is located to the Delphi library path or to your project's search path.

## Contribution

If you believe you can help improve this repository, please submit a PR, and I will review it. Any assistance is welcome.

## Delphi versions 
  - Tested in Delphi 11.0
  > I recommend using Delphi XE or better.

## Usage

Object
```pascal

uses uClassAutoFree

...

var
  LTest: TStringList;
begin
 LTest:= Garbage.Add<TStringList>(TStringList.Create);
 ...
 ...
 ...
 ... 
end;

```

LTest will be released when Garbage is destroyed
```pascal

var
  LTest: TStringList;
begin
  LTest:= Garbage.Add<TStringList>(TStringList.Create);
  try
    LTest.Add('This');
    LTest.Add('is a');
    Ltest.Add('test with collect');
    Showmessage(LTest.Text);
  finally
    Garbage.Collect(LTest);
  end;
end;

```

With input parameters in the create of the class to be collected

```pascal
begin
  FTestClass:= Garbage.Add<TMyClass>(TMyClass.Create('with input params'));
end;
```

Example of how to use the TAutoCollect class

```pascal
var
  LLocal: TMyClass;
begin
  LLocal:= TAutoCollect<TMyClass>.New(TMyClass.Create).GetInstance;
  LLocal.FParam:= 'test'; 
  Showmessage(LLocal.FParam);  
  
 //LLocal its destroyed here
end;

```
